# Anything in this file, followed by a period (and an upper-case word),
# does NOT indicate an end-of-sentence marker.
# Special cases are included for prefixes that ONLY appear before 0-9 numbers.

# Any single upper case letter  followed by a period is not a sentence ender
# (excluding I occasionally, but we leave it in)
# usually upper case letters are initials in a name
